- Today is a low efficiency day, but it's okay, it reminds me of the importance of resting.
	- I slept late yesterday almost at 4am. This morning I woke up at 8 am by the outside noises. Read the book for a while, quite relaxing.
- AI I read today is a recap of previous training tips about training and validation, under fitting and over fitting, not much new stuffs but a confirmation of the what I analyzed for previous work content.
- Another meaningful thing I finished today is reviewing, review my finance review my job application, and find out I barely use money this week, which is good. And most of the applications have no reply which is dangerous, but considering this month is quite special. It's the end of the year, and things might go slow. I still have chances if looking at the positive side.
- By doing some experiment about reading, the longest time I can read a fiction is about an hour but non fiction book only can last 45 mins.
- In terms of ROS learning, I do suffer a lot, forgot about how to write in proper. when a complex feature coming in, I am too hasty to build things together without verification step by step and in the end, when debugging I still need to break down them into spices to debug, such a time wasting.
- I am tired, what should I do? I am thinking of morning and night coding, afternoon heading to library to learn English. Ok let's try.
