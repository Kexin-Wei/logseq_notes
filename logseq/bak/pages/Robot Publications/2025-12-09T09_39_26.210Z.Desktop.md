## How to Find Rankings

### Conference Rankings
1. **CORE Rankings** - http://portal.core.edu.au/conf-ranks/
   - Tiers: A* (top 5-7%), A (~15%), B (~30%), C (meets standards)
   - Search by acronym (e.g., "ICRA") or full name
   - Filter by FoR code 4007 (Robotics) or 4603/4611 (AI/ML)
2. **Google Scholar Metrics** - h5-index (5-year citation metric)
3. **Acceptance Rates** - Lower = more selective

### Journal Rankings
1. **Impact Factor** - Journal Citation Reports (Web of Science)
2. **SJR** - scimagojr.com (free)
3. **CiteScore** - Scopus/Elsevier
4. **Google Scholar Metrics** - h5-index for journals

## Quick Facts
- ICRA and IROS = **A*** ranked (highest tier in CORE)
- RSS = **A*** ranked
- Lower acceptance rates indicate more competitive venues
- Check where leading researchers in your subfield publish
- Consider both metrics and review process quality
