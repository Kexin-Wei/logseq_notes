- broadband noise is produced by collapsing bubbles during inertial cavitation, and is by far the most widely used technique
- Detection Methods
	- Root-mean-square (RMS) amplitude in the frequency domain within a frequency window located between the harmonic peaks
		- was introduced and correlated to endothelial cell damage and hemolysis in vivo in several studies
	- Probability of cavitation occurrence
	- Cavitation persistence
- Hyperechoic Region: scattering by gas or vapor bubbles
	- At first HIFU pulse, hyperechoic region appears at where inertial cavitation was detected
	  ((633107ed-bd4e-4493-aed1-1c69926679fc))
	- inertial cavitation was observed during or before the onset of the hyperechoic region
	  ((a1ad4214-41f0-4667-b09d-b4d188e55ceb))
	- Happens after cavitation (2.5s later in  5 of 22 HIFU exposures)
