- ![](/../assets/puca_overheat_solution.png)
- should move ultrasound head whether is continuous or pulsed
- Speed of the sound head movement
	- generally 4cm/s
	- speed of sound head won't affect the damage
- cooler gel (18 degree) may decrease the surface heating issue
- room temperature (~23 degree) may enough
- Water Coupling
	- surface is hard to apply gel to make
	- room temperature
	- example treatment area: ankle
	- half efficient as direct coupling with ultrasound gel
- Bladder Coupling (not frequently used)
	- treatment part isn't flat
	- US gel on both side of bladder
