	- T1-weighted and T2-weighted images, often referred to as T1Â and T2Â images.
	- T1 : bright is fat
		- T1 images can be thought of as a map of proton energy within fatty tissues of the body
		- Fatty tissues include subcutaneous fat (**SC fat**) and bone marrow of the vertebral bodies
		- Cerebrospinal fluid (**CSF**) contains no fat â€“ so it appears black on T1-weighted images
	- T2 :  bright is fat and water
		- T2 images are a map of proton energy within fattyÂ **AND**Â water-based tissues of the body
		- Fatty tissue is distinguished from water-based tissue by comparing with the T1 images â€“ anything that is bright on the T2 images but dark on the T1 images is fluid-based tissue
		- For example, theÂ **CSF**Â is white on this T2 image and dark on the T1 image above because it is free fluid and contains no fat
		- Note that the bone cortex is black â€“ it gives off no signal on either T1 or T2 images because it contains no free protons

	- Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging
	- provides image contrast that is dependent on the random microscopic motion of water protons
	- uses a T2-weighted pulse sequence with two extra gradient pulses which is equal in magnitude and opposite in direction
	- imaging is more sensitive to water molecular motion in the direction of the additional applied gradients.
	- Higher water diffusion will result in greater signal attenuation and appears darker on the image. The magnitude of water signal attenuation on diffusion-weighted images depends on two factors: the translational movement of water molecules, and the amount of diffusion weighting.
	- The sensitivity to water diffusion is defined by the gradient factorÂ _b_Â (sec/mm2). The higher the b values, the better the sensitivity of diffusion weighted imaging (usually three to four b values are used in diffusion-weighted sequences b50, b500, b1000 and b1400).
