	- Mahatma Gandhi, born Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi on October 2, 1869, and died on January 30, 1948, was an Indian lawyer, politician, social activist, and writer who is best known for his leadership in the Indian independence movement against British rule. He is also known as the "Father of the Nation" in India.
	- Gandhi is famous for his philosophy of nonviolent civil disobedience, which he called "**Satyagraha**." He believed that nonviolence was the most powerful weapon for oppressed people to achieve social and political change. His methods inspired civil rights and freedom movements across the world, including the **American Civil Rights Movement led by Martin Luther King Jr.**
	- Gandhi's life was marked by a series of personal experiments and spiritual quests. He sought to live a simple and ascetic life, practiced vegetarianism, and advocated for self-sufficiency and communal living. His dedication to nonviolence, truth, and social justice earned him the honorific title "Mahatma," which means "great soul" in Sanskrit.
	- After years of nonviolent protests, negotiations, and political maneuvering, India finally achieved independence from British rule on August 15, 1947. Tragically, Gandhi was assassinated by a Hindu extremist less than six months later, on January 30, 1948. His legacy of nonviolence and his contributions to India's struggle for freedom continue to inspire people around the world.

- Partition of India
  collapsed:: true
	- The Partition of India was a significant event that occurred in 1947, leading to the creation of two separate nations: India and Pakistan. The partition was a result of the end of British colonial rule in the Indian subcontinent and the growing tensions between the Hindu and Muslim communities.
	- The Indian subcontinent, under British rule, was a diverse region with various religious, linguistic, and cultural groups. The two largest religious communities were Hindus and Muslims. The Indian National Congress, which was primarily led by Hindus, and the All-India Muslim League, which represented the interests of Muslims, were the two major political parties involved in the struggle for independence.
	- The idea of a separate Muslim nation was first proposed by the All-India Muslim League, led by Muhammad Ali Jinnah. The concept, called the "Two-Nation Theory," posited that Hindus and Muslims were two distinct nations and that Muslims would not receive fair treatment in a Hindu-majority India. The Lahore Resolution in 1940 called for the creation of an independent state for Muslims in the northwestern and northeastern regions of British India.
	- After World War II, the British government decided to expedite the process of granting independence to India. In 1947, Lord Mountbatten, the last Viceroy of India, proposed a plan for the partition of British India into two separate nations: India (with a Hindu majority) and Pakistan (with a Muslim majority). This plan was accepted by the Indian National Congress and the All-India Muslim League.
	- The partition led to one of the largest mass migrations in human history, as millions of Hindus, Muslims, and Sikhs crossed the newly drawn borders to join the country where their religious community was in the majority. The partition resulted in widespread violence, communal riots, and the displacement of millions of people. An estimated 10 to 15 million people were uprooted, and between 200,000 and 2 million people are believed to have been killed in the ensuing chaos.
	- The effects of the Partition of India are still felt today, as it laid the foundation for the ongoing conflicts between India and Pakistan, particularly over the disputed region of Kashmir. The partition has had a lasting impact on the politics, culture, and social dynamics of both nations.
