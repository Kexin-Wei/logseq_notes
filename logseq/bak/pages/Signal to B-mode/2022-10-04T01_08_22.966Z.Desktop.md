	- Log Compression
		- The maximum dynamic range of the human eye is in the order of **30 dB**. The actual dynamic range of the received signal depends on the **ADC** bits, the **TGC amplifier** used in the front end, and the **depth of penetration**. The signal is compressed to fit the dynamic range used for display (usually **7 or 8 bits**). It is typical to use a log compressor to achieve the desired dynamic range for display. Some parameters in the compression function can be used to adjust brightness.
