	- band-pass filtering to **reduce noise outside frequencies of interest**.
	- to select whether **imaging** is done on the **fundamental frequency** (conventional imaging) or the **second harmonic** (harmonic imaging)
- Amplitude Processing
	- Amplitude Detection or Envelope Extraction Process
		- Get a complex signal
			- An **analytic representation of the signal** is created via **Hilbert transform**. The advantage of this operation is that it is **independent of the actual frequency** of the operating frequencies and **independent of the imaging mode** (conventional versus harmonic), or changes in the center frequencies with time (e.g., a physical phenomenon in the tissue that results in a change of frequency with the depth of penetration). However, this operation is more complex compared to the alternative below
			- A **complex rotator** is used to **demodulate** the signal in baseband followed by **low pass filtering to eliminate sidelobes.** This operation is simpler and appears to be choice for implementation. However, the operating center frequency needs to be known and possibly tracked for changes.
		- The **magnitude of the resulting complex signal** is then used as **detected signal for imaging**. Additional **low pass filtering** with decimation or interpolation may be carried out on this signal before presenting this for further processing to bring the amount of data in line with display properties.

	- Log Compression
		- The maximum dynamic range of the human eye is in the order of **30 dB**. The actual dynamic range of the received signal depends on the **ADC** bits, the **TGC amplifier** used in the front end, and the **depth of penetration**. The signal is compressed to fit the dynamic range used for display (usually **7 or 8 bits**). It is typical to use a log compressor to achieve the desired dynamic range for display. Some parameters in the compression function can be used to adjust brightness.
