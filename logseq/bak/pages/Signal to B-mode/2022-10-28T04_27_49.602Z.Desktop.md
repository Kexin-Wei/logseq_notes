- Filtering
	- band-pass filtering to **reduce noise outside frequencies of interest**.
	- to select whether **imaging** is done on the **fundamental frequency** (conventional imaging) or the **second harmonic** (harmonic imaging)
- Amplitude Processing
	- Amplitude Detection or Envelope Extraction Process
		- Demodulation: Get a complex signal
			- via **Hilbert transform**
				- Pro:
					- independent of the actual frequency of the operating frequencies
					- independent of the imaging mode (either conventional versus harmonic)
					- independent of changes in the center frequencies with time (e.g., a physical phenomenon in the tissue that results in a change of frequency with the depth of penetration).
				- Con: this operation is more complex compared to the alternative below
			- via **complex rotator** in baseband followed by **low pass filtering to eliminate sidelobes.**
				- Pro: simpler
				- Con: the operating center frequency needs to be known and possibly tracked for changes.
		- Get magnitude of the complex signal, may imply additional **low pass filtering** with decimation or interpolation.

		- Logarithmic Compression + Scan Conversion
	- Log Compression
		- The maximum dynamic range of the human eye is in the order of **30 dB**. The actual dynamic range of the received signal depends on the **ADC** bits, the **TGC amplifier** used in the front end, and the **depth of penetration**. The signal is compressed to fit the dynamic range used for display (usually **7 or 8 bits**). It is typical to use a log compressor to achieve the desired dynamic range for display. Some parameters in the compression function can be used to adjust brightness.
