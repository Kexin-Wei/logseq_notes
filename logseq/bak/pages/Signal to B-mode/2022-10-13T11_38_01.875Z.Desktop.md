		- The **brightness** of the image at each point along the B-mode line is determined by the **amplitude** of the echo signals received at the transducer.
		- In some of the processes which follow beam formation, the **echo signal** still contains **the original transmit frequency**.
		- **Demodulation** of the RF signal involves **removal of the transmit frequency** leaving only the **amplitude** or **envelope** of the echo signal.
		- Processing after this is referred to as non-coherent. Some processing may be carried out after the image memory (post processing) to improve the displayed image or optimize its characteristics for a particular clinical application.
		- Various user controls interact with the transmit beam former, such as output power, field of view and focusing.

	- Filtering
		- band-pass filtering to **reduce noise outside frequencies of interest**.
		- to select whether **imaging** is done on the **fundamental frequency** (conventional imaging) or the **second harmonic** (harmonic imaging)
	- Detection
	  This **envelope extraction process** is commonly called detection in ultrasound terminology
		- first stage in this process is to **get a complex signal** using any of the following methods
			- An **analytic representation of the signal** is created via **Hilbert transform**. The advantage of this operation is that it is **independent of the actual frequency** of the operating frequencies and **independent of the imaging mode** (conventional versus harmonic), or changes in the center frequencies with time (e.g., a physical phenomenon in the tissue that results in a change of frequency with the depth of penetration). However, this operation is more complex compared to the alternative below
			- A **complex rotator** is used to **demodulate** the signal in baseband followed by **low pass filtering to eliminate sidelobes.** This operation is simpler and appears to be choice for implementation. However, the operating center frequency needs to be known and possibly tracked for changes.
		- The **magnitude of the resulting complex signal** is then used as **detected signal for imaging**. Additional **low pass filtering** with decimation or interpolation may be carried out on this signal before presenting this for further processing to bring the amount of data in line with display properties.
	- Log Compression
		- The maximum dynamic range of the human eye is in the order of **30 dB**. The actual dynamic range of the received signal depends on the **ADC** bits, the **TGC amplifier** used in the front end, and the **depth of penetration**. The signal is compressed to fit the dynamic range used for display (usually **7 or 8 bits**). It is typical to use a log compressor to achieve the desired dynamic range for display. Some parameters in the compression function can be used to adjust brightness.
