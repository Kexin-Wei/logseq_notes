- Mechanism
	- MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) is a medical imaging technique that uses a strong magnetic field and radio waves to generate detailed images of the body's internal structures. The mechanism of MRI involves the following steps:
	- Alignment of hydrogen atoms: The human body contains millions of hydrogen atoms, which have a property called [[spin]] . When placed in a strong magnetic field, these hydrogen atoms align themselves with the direction of the magnetic field.
	- Excitation of hydrogen atoms: A radiofrequency (RF) pulse is applied to the aligned hydrogen atoms, causing them to absorb energy and move away from their aligned state. This process is called resonance.
	- Relaxation of hydrogen atoms: After the RF pulse is turned off, the hydrogen atoms return to their aligned state and release the absorbed energy as electromagnetic signals.
	- Detection of electromagnetic signals: A receiver coil detects the electromagnetic signals released by the hydrogen atoms and sends them to a computer.
	- Image reconstruction: The computer processes the signals and creates a detailed image of the body's internal structures.
	- The strength of the magnetic field and the timing of the RF pulses are carefully controlled to produce different types of MRI images, such as T1-weighted, T2-weighted, and diffusion-weighted images. MRI can be used to image soft tissues, such as the brain, spinal cord, and internal organs, and is often used to diagnose a variety of medical conditions, including cancer, neurological disorders, and joint injuries.
