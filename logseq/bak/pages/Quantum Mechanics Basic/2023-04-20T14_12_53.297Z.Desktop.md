	- [Larmor precession - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larmor_precession)
		- The Larmor or precession frequency is the rate at which spins wobble when placed in a magnetic field.
		- $\omega_0=\gamma B_0$
			- $\gamma$: gyromagnetic ratio
	- Stable State
		- into a stable state, longitudinal magnetization Mz is building up in the z-direction because the magnetic vectors representing the individual magnetic moments add together
- Lez's Law
	- $\mathcal{E}=-\frac{\mathrm{d} \Phi_{\mathrm{B}}}{\mathrm{d} t}$
- Resonance Condition
	- Energy can be introduced into such a stable spin system by applying an electromagnetic wave of the same frequency as the Larmor frequency

- Wave-particle duality
	- ![](https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hUjJhhMt4bBb6CvckbfDAJ-1200-80.jpg)
	- At the quantum level, particles (such as electrons) exhibit both wave-like and particle-like behavior. This means they can sometimes behave as a continuous wave, while at other times, they act as discrete particles.
- Superposition
	- {{video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZUipVyVOm-Y}}
	- In quantum mechanics, particles can exist in multiple states simultaneously until they are measured. This phenomenon is called superposition.
	- Example
		- Most of the light we see around us is a combination of many different waves coming from the sun and other sources. The peaks and valleys of these waves are rotated in different directions at once. In other words, the light is in a superposition of these different polarized states.
		- Superposition becomes apparent when we arrange more than one filter in different ways to tease out additional properties of light. Light that passes through a horizontal filter will have a 100 percent chance of passing through a second horizontal filter, i.e., all of it will pass through. If this second filter is gradually rotated toward a vertical orientation, the chance of the light passing through both filters steadily decreases. Half of the light will pass through when the filter reaches the diagonal (45 degrees), and no light will pass through when the filter is vertical.

		- If superposition did not exist, light would be completely blocked as soon as the second filter was rotated by even a fraction of a degree because all of the light that went through the first filter would be strictly horizontally polarized.
- Quantum states and wave functions
	- [Is there a difference between a quantum state and a quantum wave function?](https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/591257/is-there-a-difference-between-a-quantum-state-and-a-quantum-wave-function)
	- Quantum states are described by mathematical functions called wave functions, which contain information about the probabilities of finding a particle in different positions or energy states.

- Uncertainty principle
	- or **Heisenberg's uncertainty principle**
	- {{video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8FTr2qMutA}}
	- {{video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwWRX9IdblE}}
	- $\sigma _{x}\sigma _{p}\geq {\frac {\hbar }{2}}$
		- standard deviation of position $\sigma_x$
		- standard deviation of momentum $\sigma_p$
		- where $\hbar$ is the [reduced Planck constant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reduced_Planck_constant), *h*/(2*π*).
	- Formulated by Werner Heisenberg, this principle states that it is impossible to simultaneously know both the position and momentum of a particle with perfect accuracy. The more accurately one quantity is known, the less accurately the other can be known.
- Quantum entanglement
	- Entanglement occurs when two or more particles become interconnected in such a way that the state of one particle cannot be described independently of the other, even if they are separated by large distances.
	- This phenomenon has significant implications for quantum computing and quantum communication.
		- If the researcher measures the direction of one particle's spin and then repeats the measurement on its distant, entangled partner, that researcher will always find that the pair are correlated: if one particle's spin is up, the other's will be down
- Quantum tunneling
	- In quantum mechanics, particles can "tunnel" through energy barriers that would be insurmountable according to classical physics. This phenomenon is responsible for various effects, such as nuclear decay and the operation of some electronic devices.
- Schrödinger's equation
	- $i\hbar {\frac {d}{dt}}\psi (t)=H\psi (t)$
		- H denotes the Hamiltonian, the observable corresponding to the total energy of the system
		- $\hbar$  is the reduced Planck constant.
	- This is a fundamental equation in quantum mechanics that describes how the wave function of a physical system changes over time. It is used to calculate the probabilities of different outcomes when a quantum system is observed.
- Hilbert Space
	- It is an infinite-dimensional vector space with an inner product, which allows for the definition of length and angles between vectors.
	- Hilbert space is used to represent the set of all possible quantum states of a system. Each quantum state is represented as a vector in this space, and the rules of quantum mechanics can be formulated in terms of the geometry and algebra of the Hilbert space.
	- it allows for the use of linear operators, which can represent physical observables (such as position or momentum) and the time evolution of quantum states.
