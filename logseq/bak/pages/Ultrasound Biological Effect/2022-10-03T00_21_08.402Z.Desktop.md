- Thermal Bioeffect
	- Calculation
		- Thermal Energy: $Q=2\alpha I t$, J/cm2
			- $\alpha = 0.026f^{1.1}$ : absorption ratio
			- $I$: [[1 Sound Intensity |sound intensity]], average along time
			- $t$ : time
		- Temperature Increase: $\Delta T$
			- $\rho C_t \Delta T = 2 \alpha I \Delta t$
			- $\rho$ : tissue density, g/cm3
			- $C_t$ : specific heat capacity, Jg/K
			- $t$ : time
		- if >50 degree: protein denaturation, can kill tumor
	- Measurement : Thermal Index
		- Thermal Index (TI) : intended as a measure of an ultrasound beam's **thermal** bioeffects.
		- thermal index = Wp / Wdeg
			- Wp: relevant (attenuated) acoustic power at the depth of interest
			- Wdeg: estimated power necessary to raise the tissue equilibrium temperature by one degree Celsius
- Mechanical Bioeffect
	- Any process that can produce a biological effect without a significant degree of heating (ie, less than ≈1°C above the physiologic temperature) is a nonthermal mechanism. Nonthermal bioeffects can result from physical mechanisms such as acoustic cavitation, radiation force, and acoustic streaming.
	- If the sound pressure $p$ is big enough,  the tissue cells will be broken
- Acoustic Cavitation
	- [Cavitation category](((6327bde9-1db0-47bb-9c8c-b01dab993153)))
	- Cavitation Mechanism
		- Inertial Cavitation
			- cavitation nuclei (small bubbles) expand in negative pressure, compressed and break up in positive pressure
			- when compressed, temperature can reach 1000 degree
		- Stable Cavitation
			- if bubbles are big enough, can resonance with ultrasound
	- Measurement : Mechanical Index
	  Mechanical Index (MI) : ultrasound beam's bioeffect
		- proportional to an ultrasound beam's peak negative pressure (or peak rarefaction pressure).
		- $MI = \frac{P_r}{\sqrt{f_c}}$
