	- Multiview fusion
		- same modality, same time, different places or condition
		- supply complementary information from different views
	- Multimodal fusion
		- different modalities: PET, CT, MRI, visible, infrared, ultraviolet
		- decrease the amount of data, to emphasize band-specific information
	- Multimodal fusion with different resolution
		- One image with high spatial resolution, the other one with low spatial but higher spectral resolution
		- To get an image with high spatial and spectral resolution
		- Method: replacing bands in DWT (discrete wavelet transform)
	- Multitemporal fusion
		- same scene, different time, (same modality)
		- detect the changes
		- Method: subtraction
	- Multifocus fusion
		- The original image can be divided into regions such that every region is in focus in at least one channel
		- Method: identify the regions in focus and combine them together
	- Fusion for image restoration
		- Each image consists of “true” part and “degradation”, which can be removed by fusion
		- Types of degradation
			- additive noise: image denoising, averaging over multiple
			- convolution: blind deconvolution
			- resolution decimation: superresolution
- Algorithm
	- Multimodal Fusion Algorithm
		- Weighted averaging pixel-wise
		- Fusion in transform domains
		- Object-level fusion
		- rigid fusion: no compensation of patient motion and position
		- deformable fusion: structure or shape change
- Application
	- Cancer staging
	- **Biopsy planning**
	- **Radiotherapy treatment planning**
	- Quantitative assessment of treatment response
	- Pre-surgical assessment of other conditions, e.g. epilepsy
	- As an effective communication tool when reporting to clinical meetings, referring physicians or to patients
	- Whenever multiple data sources may be better assessed together
