- The results showed that the normalized backscatter intensity decreased exponentially with increasing number of pulses.

- our recent studies have demonstrated that cavitation can be controlled to achieve consistent soft tissue ablation using extremely short (<20 μs) and intense (>8 mPa) ultrasound pulses delivered at low duty cycles (<1%) [10]–[16].

- With a sufficient number of successive pulses, the cavitation activities can completely fractionate tissue to a subcellular level, resulting in a highly disintegrated volume with sharply demarcated boundaries[13], [15]

- several ultrasound imaging methods have also been investigated to monitor the thermal tissue damage by measuring the changes in tissue elasticity, sound velocity, and acoustic attenuation[23]–[28]

- In comparison, the fractionated tissue volume produced by histotripsy can be visualized clearly as a hypoechoic region using standard ultrasound B-mode imaging.

- his phenomenon likely occurs because tissue is mechanically subdivided into small fragments that cannot effectively scatter ultrasound at the imaging frequency used

- The intactness of a cell is determined by the appearance of its cell nucleus on histology. The cell nucleus is selected because it is a common indication of cell damage or death.

- The flushed kidneys were then sealed in Ziploc bags filled with saline, mounted to a motorized 3-axis positioning system (Parker Hannifin, rohnert Park, ca), and submerged in a tank of degassed, deionized water during experimentation.
