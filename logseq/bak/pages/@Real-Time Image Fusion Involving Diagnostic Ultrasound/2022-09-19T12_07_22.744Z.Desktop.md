- [[Abstract]]
	- OBJECTIVE. The aim of our article is to give an overview of the current and future possibilities of real-time image fusion involving ultrasound. We present a review of the existing English-language peer-reviewed literature assessing this technique, which covers technical solutions (for ultrasound and endoscopic ultrasound), image fusion in several anatomic regions, and electromagnetic needle tracking. CONCLUSION. The recent progress of real-time ultrasound in image fusion may provide several new possibilities, including diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up of oncologic patients.

- [[Notes]]
	- The registration process requires the computation of a transformation matrix composed of translations and rotations that define the differences in spatial location between two datasets.
	- One method to coregister two datasets is to define a series of **standard registration points**, which can be either external (fiducials, placed on the patient) or internal (common anatomic structures)
