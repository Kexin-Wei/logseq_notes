# 1.  Cavitation
## 1.1.  Definition
*Reference 1*
- Acoustic cavitation refers to the response of **gas bubbles** in a liquid under the influence of an acoustic (ultrasonic) wave.
- Cavitation only **occurs** if suitable cavitation **nuclei exist** to seed the cavitation process. These nuclei are typically **microbubbles** or **solid particles in suspension**, or **bubbles** trapped in crevices at a solid surface.

- Stable (or non-inertial) cavitation
	- a pulsating or ‘breathing’ motion of a bubble whose **diameter follows the pressure variation** in the ultrasonic wave.
	- During the **compression** in the wave, the bubble contracts in size, **expanding** again as the rarefaction phase in the wave passes. Over time the bubble may **grow** by a process of ‘rectified diffusion’, or it may **contract** and dissolve back into the **liquid**.
	- Free, solitary bubbles have a resonant frequency $f_r$ depending on their radius $R_0$, $f_r R_0\approx 3Hz$
- Inertial cavitation
	- occur at higher peak acoustic pressures

## 1.3.  Characteristics
*Reference 4*
- Cavitation activity and the threshold for cavitation nucleation also depend significantly on tissue composition (Maxwell et al. 2013); therefore, the results obtained for a single tissue type may not be uniformly applicable to other tissues.
- The cavitation event was considered **observed** if its arrival time exceeded the aforementioned time delay, and if the signal amplitude exceeded the maximum amplitude of the background noise by $\sqrt 5$ the Rose criterion.
- It is known that the **surface** of tissue samples, and the **animal skin** in the case of in vivo exposures, often harbors many more small air bubbles and cavitation nuclei than the bulk tissue. Cavitation events at a given peak-rarefactional pressure level are therefore more **likely** to occur at the **sample surface** rather than **within the sample**.
	- In all the ex vivo tissue and gel phantom exposures, HIFU focus was **intentionally** placed no less than **1 cm deep** within the tissue to **avoid cavitation at the surface**. However, since the axial size of the focal regions of HIFU transducers are rather large, cavitation at the sample surface could still occur at the highest power outputs.
	- In the case of in vivo experiments, the depth of tumor location in some cases was less than 1 cm, which made cavitation at the skin surface more probable.
## 1.4.  Inertial Cavitation Characteristics
- Inertial Cavitation only happens in **focal zone**, but also determined by
	- **FUS field strength**
	- the population of **cavitation nuclei**
	- the **observations** were **hindered** by incorrectly estimated propagation conditions
- **main lobe >** cavitation threshold
- side lobe < cavitation threshold
- with **high pressure**, cavitation may happen **outside** of treatment zone, mostly at **gas pocket**
- if at **rib** area, careful with **pressure**, otherwise the surrounding tissue may **damage**
- Cavitation threshold of **ex vivo for water based tissues** : **26-30MPa**
	- blood clots, liver, kidney, heat, brain, spleen, pancreas, blood and water
- Inertial cavitation was found to **increase** initially and then **decrease** with **long pulse duration and high PRF**.
# 2.  Board Band Noise
*Reference 4*
- Multiple techniques are available and have been shown useful for characterizing cavitation activity during HIFU exposures (McLaughlan et al. 2010a), with passive cavitation detection (PCD) of **broadband noise**, produced by **collapsing bubbles during inertial cavitation**, being by far the most **widely used** technique
- Several different ways to interpret the signals acquired by PCD, i.e. cavitation activity metrics, are currently in use.
	- Inertial cavitation dose - the root-mean-square (RMS) amplitude, in the frequency domain, of the broadband noise within a frequency window located between the harmonic peaks - was introduced and correlated to endothelial cell damage and hemolysis in vivo in several studies
	- Probability of cavitation occurrence
	- cavitation persistence
## 2.1.  Bubbles in HIFU
*Reference 2*
- bubbles were produced at the focus during the formation of the initial hyperechoic region and per fused to adjacent tissues in the near field, resulting in the production of an additional hyperechoic region
- During HIFU ablation of dog thigh muscle in vivo, Hynynen (1991) observed that the **hyperechoic region** appeared after the **first HIFU pulse** in which **inertial cavitation** was detected
- As a result of this study, the presence of a hyperechoic region in an US image has been used to **determine if cavitation occurred** during lithotripsy
- correlate with a rapid **rise in temperature**
	- Because unpredictable lesion formation and a rapid rise in temperature may result from the presence of bubbles in the US field, avoidance of cavitation was proposed for better control of **lesion formation** during HIFU treatment
## 2.2.  PCD & BBN
*Reference 2*
- **Passive cavitation detection** consisted of measuring the levels of **broadband noise** (between 0.5 to 1.5 MHz) and subharmonic noise (at half of the fundamental frequency, 1.66 MHz) from Fourier spectra of the collected RF signal.
- Broadband noise and subharmonic noise were used as indicators of **inertial** (IC) and stable **cavitation** (SC), respectively
- The level of inertial cavitation was determined by calculating the **root-mean-square** (r.m.s.) amplitude of the broadband noise for each spectrum over the frequency range of **0.5 to 1.5 MHz**
- signal processing: raw RF data -> Fourier transform -> spectral analysis -> ?
- The onset time of a significant level of IC at the HIFU focus was defined as the time of the first HIFU pulse in which the maximal amplitude of the broadband noise was greater than three SD (p $\lt$ 0.005) above the mean broadband noise measured during recordings of acoustic emissions before each HIFU exposure
- **PCD** was performed to **determine** whether **inertial** and/or stable ** ** contributed to the appearance of the hyperechoic region.
- inertial cavitation was observed during or before the onset of the hyperechoic region.
- The appearance of a **hyperechoic region in the US image** was, therefore, due to **scattering by the gas** and/or vapor bubbles produced at the HIFU focus during cavitation.
- the observation of cavitation before the appearance of a hyperechoic region is an indication that the cavitation detector provided a more sensitive measure of the presence of cavitating bubbles than did the US imager
- When using the appearance of a hyperechoic region to determine if cavitation is present during HIFU therapy, it is important to be aware of the possibility of the **appearance of a hyperechoic region occurring well after cavitation**. During 5 of 22 HIFU exposures at an intensity of 1280 W/cm2, the appearance of a hyperechoic region occurred over **2.5 s** after that of cavitation.
  
  *Reference 3*
- All sampled waveforms were first transformed to the frequency domain using fast Fourier transform (FFT) routines
- in addition to the nonlinear oscillation of the bubbles, the oscillation of the vessel wall as well as the nonlinearity of the HIFU pulses contributed to the harmonic signals in the frequency domain
- we chose to measure the IC activity by the amount of the broadband noise in a narrow spectral band within a given signal. We chose a frequency window between **3.94 to 4.14 MHz** and calculated the root mean square (RMS) amplitude of the **broadband noise** to minimize the influence of the harmonic peaks (Fig. 4c).
## 2.3.  Synchronization of HIFU and US
*Reference 1*
- the excitation pulse of the 64th element of the imaging probe was used as a **synchronization pulse.**
- The excitation pulse was converted into a transistor-transistor logic (**TTL**)-high pulse, using three pulse generators in series
- The TTL-high pulse was used externally to gate a **frequency generator**
- The passage of the signal from the frequency generator to a **power amplifier** was gated to a specific duration by a computer controlled custom-built relay board.
- This set the HIFU duration to 10 s and synchronized the HIFU exposure with the collection of the cavitation radiofrequency (RF) signal on a digital oscilloscope. The amplified signal was sent to a custom-built electrical matching network (matched to a 50-$\Omega$ load) and then to the HIFU transducer.
# 3.  Harmonic Waves
[ref](https://dsp.stackexchange.com/questions/61908/i-dont-understand-harmonics-why-do-they-happen#:~:text=Harmonics%20%22happen%22%20when%20your%20input,floor%20and%20any%20windowing%20artifacts)
- Harmonics "happen" when your input to an FFT isn't a pure unmodulated sine wave.
- Any unexpected distortion in your input waveform generation (from being exactly identical to mix of sin(wt) + cos(wt)) can be the cause of harmonics appearing in an FFT result (above the noise floor and any windowing artifacts).
- Those harmonics are required to represent the energy of any differences whatsoever between a periodic signal and a perfect sinewave of the same frequency. If harmonics aren't there, then there can't be any differences (assuming a integer periodic input), because a single result bin of an FFT can only represent a pure sinusoid.
  
  *Reference 5*
- Both noninertial and inertial acoustic cavitation events have been shown to generate emissions at subharmonics (f0/ni) and superharmonics (ni f0) of the drive frequency, although it is believed that the violent collapse of inertial cavitation bubbles is the only source of broadband emissions
- As intensity was increased, half harmonic was detected in 0, 60 and 100%, and integrated broadband was detected in 0, 27 and 53% of the exposures in the three regimes.
- Difficulty in detection of broadband emissions may be caused by attenuation of these signals (4 to 12 MHz) in tissue, whereas this is less significant for the half-harmonic emissions.
# 4.  Signal Processing
- Goal: get BBN without harmonic noise
- *Reference 4*
	- First, each signal was **band-pass filtered** in the frequency domain (MATLAB function fir1), with the filter band of **2.3–8.8 MHz**, which corresponds to the sensitive band of the PCD, in order to eliminate the main HIFU harmonic backscattered from the sample as well as high-frequency noise. Since the majority of the focal HIFU waveforms used in this study were significantly nonlinearly distorted, the backscattered harmonics of the HIFU wave dominated the band-pass filtered PCD signal
	- To eliminate the harmonic, ultraharmonic and superharmonic content in the PCD signal, a **notch-shaped comb filter** (notch bandwidth 100 kHz) The bandwidth of 100 kHz is the half-maximum width of the spectral peak at each harmonic, so the comb filter removes the contribution from each harmonic and ultraharmonic.

# 5.  In Vivo vs Ex Vivo
*Reference 4*
the quantitative difference in the cavitation nucleation threshold and cavitation activity metrics between in vivo and ex vivo conditions in the same tissue type has been a subject of long-term debate. Commonly, the cavitation threshold is believed to be **lower** for **ex vivo** tissues, primarily due to the **absence of circulation ex vivo**, and the **presence of higher dissolved gas concentrations** resulting from tissue decomposition, outgassing and potential exposure to air during tissue sample preparation
