- # Purpose
	- map $J(x)$ to $I(x)$ using projection $T$
	- Goal: $T=\text{arg} \min\sum_k \text{sim} (I(x), J[T(x)])$
		- $\text{sim}()$ is the similarity criterion
- # Steps

	- Transformation of the Moved Image
	- Interpolation of images
	- Similarity Calculation of Moved and Fixed Image
	- Optimization
