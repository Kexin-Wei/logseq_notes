	- OptiCouple: Clearing the way to better treatment
		- Dornierâ€™s unique solution to optimizing the coupling process makes treatments 43% more effective
		- Only Dornier offers Optical Coupling Control, relying on an integrated camera in the therapy head to provide visual information on air inclusions in the coupling interface. The **removal of air bubbles in the coupling gel** is paramount to effective, efficient treatment. Disruptions in the coupling gel can considerably impair the disintegrating ability of the shock wave, and may even result in side effects such as petechiae.
		  
		  Proper coupling aided by Dornier OptiCouple optimizes shock wave treatment so urologists can treat better, faster.

		- X-ray
		- With the help of ultrasound and X-ray imaging, the shock wave generator is positioned so that the shock waves are concentrated on the stone. X-rays and/or ultrasounds are also used to check the success of the treatment during and after the procedure.
