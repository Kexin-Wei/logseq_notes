- # Fundamentals
	- Registration (matching)
	  collapsed:: true
		- Geometric (and Photometric) alignment of one image with another
		- Images may be of same or different types (MR, CT, â€¦) - mono-modality registration vs multi-modality registration
	- Fusion (matching + complete)
	  collapsed:: true
		- No single image modality provides a complete picture in all cases
		- images of different modalities & infer a more comprehensive story than provided by either
	- Fusion  = registration + combination of each own representation
	- [[Homogeneous Transformation]]
- # Categories
	- By Modalities
		- Mono-modality Registration
			- [[Ultrasound Image Registration]]
		- Multi-modality Registration
			- [[US-MRI Image Registration]]
	- By [[Homogeneous Transformation]]
# Purpose
	- map $J(x)$ to $I(x)$ using projection $T$
	- Goal: $T=\text{arg} \min\sum_k \text{sim} (I(x), J[T(x)])$
		- $\text{sim}()$ is the similarity criterion
# Steps
	- [[Feature-based Image Registration Steps]]
	- Transformation of the Moved Image
	- Interpolation of images
	- Similarity Calculation of Moved and Fixed Image
	- Optimization
