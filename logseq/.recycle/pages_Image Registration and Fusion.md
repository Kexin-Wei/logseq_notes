- # Fundamentals
	- Registration (matching)
	  collapsed:: true
		- Geometric (and Photometric) alignment of one image with another
		- Images may be of same or different types (MR, CT, â€¦) - mono-modality registration vs multi-modality registration
	- Fusion (matching + complete)
	  collapsed:: true
		- No single image modality provides a complete picture in all cases
		- images of different modalities & infer a more comprehensive story than provided by either
	- Fusion  = registration + combination of each own representation
- [[Homogeneous Transformation]]
