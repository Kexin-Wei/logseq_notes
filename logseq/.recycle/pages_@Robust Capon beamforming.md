- [[Abstract]]
	- The Capon beamformer has better resolution and much better interference rejection capability than the standard (data-independent) beamformer, provided that the array steering vector corresponding to the signal of interest (SOI) is accurately known. However, whenever the knowledge of the SOI steering vector is imprecise (as is often the case in practice), the performance of the Capon beamformer may become worse than that of the standard beamformer. We present a natural extension of the Capon beamformer to the case of uncertain steering vectors. The proposed robust Capon beamformer can no longer be expressed in a closed form, but it can be efficiently computed. Its excellent performance is demonstrated via a number of numerical examples.
