- [[Abstract]]
	- An analysis of a passive seismic method for subsurface imaging is presented, in which ambient seismic noise is employed as the source of illumination of underground scatterers. The imaging algorithm can incorporate new data into the image in a recursive fashion, which causes image background noise to diminish over time. Under the assumption of spatially-incoherent ambient noise, an analytical expression for the point-spread function of the imaging algorithm is derived. The point-spread function (PDF) characterizes the resolution of the image, which is a function of the receiving array length and the ambient noise bandwidth. Results of a Monte Carlo simulation are presented to illustrate the theory.
