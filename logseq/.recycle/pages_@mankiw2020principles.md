- [[Notes]]
	- Ch.1 Ten Principles of Economics
	  collapsed:: true
		- Economists normally assume that people are rational. Rational people systemati-
		  cally and purposefully do the best they can to achieve their objectives, given the 
		  available opportunities.
		- Rational people know that decisions in life are rarely black and white but usu-
		  ally involve shades of gray
		- most policies aim either to enlarge the economic pie or to change how the pie is divided
		- market failure to refer to a situation in which the market on its own fails to produce an efficient allocation of resources.
		- pardon me, Willie, but are we worse off because of the job losses in agriculture? the would-have-been farmers are now college professors and computer gurus.
