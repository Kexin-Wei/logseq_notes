- It has been two weeks that I am out of office.
- This week I have learned the basic of *ROS2* including nodes, topics, services and etc.. It has been quite a fun. Tomorrow I will finish a simple project to close the beginner journey.
- *AI* is another part that I am learning now.
	- *Transfer learning* is a fast learning approach, from simple trying in google Colab, I have a feeling which might be wrong, that it is fast yet hard to tune to a good result given the methods of transfer learning (either part frozen or fully frozen with new layer added behind)
	- Concurrently I am reading the famous *Deep learning* ðŸŒ¸ book. The one thing I feel is the regret that I haven't started to read this book earlier. It not only covers the general topics that are widespread in AI industries and also introduces the fundamental of deep reinforcement learning. More importantly, it explains things in a way that people all can interpret it without much effort.
	- Sutton, my mentor in reinforcement learning, emphasised the correct way of deep learning is the opposite of human learning way in his blog *"The Bitter Lesson"*. His thinking in *continuous learning* is interesting, but now still in the early stage.
- I need to keep on track, exercise regularly.
