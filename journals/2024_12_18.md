- Today I learned how to use ROS official document and tried a little bit about threading. Taking step by step is correct and progressing.
- I have a dark thought about meaningless learning of technology, and simply feel tired about keep learning. I guess it's a short burnout only and I hope so.
- Tonight has a good rest. Watched a Chinese movie, *Her Story*（好东西）. It is a feminist and funny movie. The director has some talented scenes using cinematography skills. I like her previous movie 爱情神话 as well.
- I want to make my own movie and music, even though it has no meaning and lesson to teach others or any value to share.
