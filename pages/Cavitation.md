	- cavitation nuclei + pressure -> gas bubbles
		- cavitation nuclei: microbubbles \ solid particles in suspension \ bubbles trapped in crevices at a solid surface
- Categroteris

	- Stable Cavitation \ Non-inertial Cavitation
		- bubbles in pulsating or breathing motion
		- at the end, will grow in process rectified #ðŸ“‘READ \ or dissolve back into liquid
	- Inertial Cavitation
		- occur at higher peak acoustic pressures
- # Characteristics

	- Cavitation Threshold: below is stable cavitation, above is inertial cavitation, depend significantly on tissue composition
	- Cavitation is likely to occur at surface than inside due to small air bubbles and cavitation nuclei trapped on the surface of tissue and animal skin
		- To avoid cavitation at the surface, HIFU focus needs to place more than 1cm deep in ex vivo tissue
	- Inertial Cavitation Characteristics
		- only in focal zone
			- at main lobe > cavitation threshold, side lobe < cavitation threshold
			- but also determined by a. FUS field strength, b. cavitation nuclei, c. hindering
		- With high pressure, can still happen outside of treatment zone, mostly at gas pocket area
		- Rib area, the surrounding tissue is easy to be damaged
		- Water based tissues Threshold in ex vivo: 26-30MPa (blood clots, liver, kidney, heat, brain, spleen, pancreas, blood and water)
		- Increase with long pulse duration and high PRF and then decrease
		- Causes rise in temperature
