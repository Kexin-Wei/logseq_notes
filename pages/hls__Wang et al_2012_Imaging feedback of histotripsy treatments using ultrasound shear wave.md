- quantitative measurement of the ultrasound backscatter intensity can be used to predict the degree of tissue fractionation as the scattering tissue structures are progressively fractionated to small debris that no longer scatters ultrasound effectively [9], [10]

- In contrast to thermal therapy, which produces stiffened tissues, histotripsy results in soft homogenized tissues in the treated volume. such tissue transformation may be detected with high sensitivity using elastography because of the potentially high contrast in elasticity between normal and treated tissues.

- Because the system can only receive signals from 64 channels a time, 2 successive transmit-receive sequences, each lasting for 77 μs, were conducted to collect the backscatter signals from the 38 × 38 mm field of view. a total of 72 frames were acquired from 1 ms after the pushing beams at a rate of 3000 frames per second.

- Fig. 2. spatial-temporal displacement images acquired at different times after the shear wave generation in the phantoms: (a) control, (b) 100 pulses, and (c) 1000 pulses. The positive and negative displacements indicate directions of motions toward and away from the imaging probe, respectively. The shear waves were generated in the left part of the field of view, centered at around x = −8 mm, and propagated away from the push region in opposite directions. The shear waves propagated at a lower speed in the lesion area, resulting in a bent wavefront as shown in panels (b) and (c). The curvature increased with increasing numbers of therapy pulses. The shear waves could not propagate far into the lesions created with more than1000 pulses/location.

- Fig. 3. (a) B-mode and (b) shear wave velocity images of a representative lesion produced in the agar-graphite phantoms with increasing numbers of therapy pulses per treatment location. The treated volume became increasingly hypoechoic. correspondingly, the shear wave velocity decreased in the treated volume. The lesions were more easily detected on the elastography than on the B-mode when small numbers of therapy pulses were applied (e.g., 100 pulses/location). The shear wave velocity in some areas opposite the push region (e.g., the areas indicated by black arrows) could not be measured. noticeable noise was also present in the far end of the lesion (e.g., the areas indicated with the white arrows). These likely occurred because the shear waves were unable to propagate far into a significantly fractionated volume.
