- Peak Negative Acoustic Pressure
	- ![](/../assets/peak_negative_pressure.png)
	- Negative acoustic pressure -> acoustic wave is trying to pull the water molecules apart -> lasts for long enough -> probably a cavitation bubble.
- Frequency
	- Frequency is important to safety
	- Absorption coefficient of most soft tissues increases with frequency
	- Leading to energy being absorbed in a smaller volume and producing higher temperature rises.
- Pulse Average Intensity
	- $I=\frac{p^2}{\rho c}$
	  $p$ is the pressure, $c$ is the speed of sound in the medium and $\rho$ is its density
- Temporal Average Intensity
	- time-averaged value of the intensity at a particular point in the field is called the "temporal average intensity"
