	  In any case, you will need to get started with reading up on machine learning. i would suggest you first briefly start with neural networks, followed by deep convolutional neural networks just to get used to the idea of deep learning and subsequently focus on picking up reinforcement learning. As this machine learning field heavily requires you to be able to do programming, I would suggest that you try to implement the models you learnt and get familiar with the various packages of pytorch, tensorflow, fastai.

		- 3 tips
			- can't get app-key, find [solution](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46673717/gpg-cant-connect-to-the-agent-ipc-connect-call-failed)
			    
			    ```bash
			    sudo apt remove gpg
			    sudo apt-get update -y
			    sudo apt-get install -y gnupg1
			    ```
			- fresh hand following the tutorial, get cricked out because of ssh update after the buildung the instance. find solution [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26193535/error-gcloud-compute-ssh-usr-bin-ssh-exited-with-return-code-255#:~:text=If%20you%20have%20installed%20gcloud%20without%20sudo%2C%20you%20can%20omit%20sudo%20.&text=255%20is%20the%20interactive%20ssh,executed%20in%20the%20ssh%20session.&text=Go%20to%20your%20google%20cloud,tab%20and%20click%20on%20edit.). MAKE SURE THE INSTANCE IS RUNNING!!!
			    
			    `gcloud compute config -ssh`
			- get error like:
			    
			    ```bash
			    # error type 1
