title:: hls__Briot_Khalil_2015_Dynamics of Parallel Robots

- for some robots, the exact solution is obtained by analyzing the kinematic constraints and taking into account the coupling between the loops (Hervé 1978; Le Borzec and Lotterie 1975). In the following, we present two methods: the Morokine’s method and the Gogu’s method.
