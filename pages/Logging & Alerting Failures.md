- Insufficient logging and monitoring allowing attacks to go undetected.
- ## How It Works
	- a) Missing Logs
		- Failed logins not logged
		- No audit trail for sensitive operations
	- b) Inadequate Monitoring
		- No alerting on suspicious patterns
		- Logs not reviewed
	- c) Insufficient Log Detail
		- Missing context (IP, user, timestamp)
	- d) No Log Protection
		- Logs can be modified or deleted by attackers
- ## Real-World Examples
	- **Equifax (2017)**: Breach went undetected for 76 days
	- **Target (2013)**: Ignored alerts led to 40M card records stolen
	- **Uber (2016)**: Breach hidden for a year due to poor logging
	- **Marriott (2018)**: 4-year breach undetected, 500M records compromised
- ## Defense
	- Log all authentication events
	- Log access control failures
	- Centralized log management
	- Real-time alerting on anomalies
	- Tamper-proof log storage
	- Regular log reviews
