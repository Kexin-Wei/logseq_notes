- Hamming window aims to cancel the 1st side-lobesÂ introducedÂ by the Dirichlet kernel (the DTFT of the rectangular window).
- The Hann window (same numberÂ of cosine terms) does this approximately using a tidy factor of 1/2.
- TheÂ Blackman window introduces moreÂ cosine terms to cancel more side lobes.
- Slepian window, whichÂ is an optimal formulation that maximizes the power in the main lobe.
- interested in measuring the frequency, the best window to use is the rectangular.
