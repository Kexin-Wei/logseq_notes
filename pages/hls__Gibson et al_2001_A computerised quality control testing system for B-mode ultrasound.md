- a suite of programs to analyse captured US images to estimate a number of performance parameters, including resolution, high- and low-contrast penetration depths and high- and low-contrast sensitivity

- . At a user level, there are frequent, simple visual checks for mechanical damage and monitor settings and basic checks for sensitivity and calliper accuracy. More advanced tests using tissue equivalent test objects are recommended for testing for long-term drifts in performance at longer intervals (e.g., biannually).

- acoustic power was set to100% and a preset was selected appropriate to clinical usage for the probe under test and to give as uniform an image as possible. Abdominal presets are often appropriate because they are suited to the uniform attenuation of the test object. Where TGC was preprogrammed, controls were set to mid range (i.e., no adjustment to preprogrammed values).

- The probes used were 3.5MHz and 5-MHz curved arrays and a 7.5-MHz linear array. Each probe was operating at its maximum frequency to maximise the likelihood of the penetration depths being within depth of the image (i.e., at 5, 7.5 and10 MHz, respectively).

- One method requires targets with varying separations so that a visual assessment of resolution may be made. This has the disadvantages of being quantised (i.e., it may be expressed only in terms of the target separations used) and providing measures at a small number of depths. The second method requires a column of wires extending to the full depth of the test object, which are imaged and widths measured in the axial and lateral directions.

- For each wire identified, the program measured its width, in both the axial and lateral directions, using the full width half maximum above the surrounding background pixel level, as indicated in Fig. 4. The surrounding background pixel level was found by examining those pixels on the axial profile through the wire a distance of between 0.25 and 0.75 of the specified wire spacing, l, from the peak, in both directions. The mean of these pixel values was used as the surrounding background pixel level and the standard deviation,bgd was also calculated for use in the high-contrast penetration method (see below).

- These measurements were plotted against depth of the wire. A 3-point moving average filter, with equal tap weights was applied to the series of lateral measurements and this was also plotted against depth. This smoothing was done in an attempt to reduce the effect of speckle giving outlying values of FWHM for some wires.

- Low-contrast penetration (LCP) is normally measured as the depth below which speckle is not visible.
