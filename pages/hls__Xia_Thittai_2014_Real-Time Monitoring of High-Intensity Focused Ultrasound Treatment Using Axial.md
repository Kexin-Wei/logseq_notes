- proposed that by tracking shifts in the backscatter radiofrequency (RF) signal, caused by changes in the speed of sound with change in temperature, temperature estimation for real-time monitoring is feasible.

- A major challenge to ARFI-based approaches is their reliance on pulse sequences necessary for radiation pressure-induced motion, which may require long exposure times and prolong the duration of HIFU treatment.

- HIFU heating was carried out for 115 and 25 s (total time) at the low- and highpower settings, respectively After HIFU sonication, we acquired several subsequent sets of elastographic RF data at the same time intervals to keep monitoring temporal changes in HIFU-induced lesions.

- Elastographic compression was controlled by the stepper motor. A total compression of 2 mm was applied by moving the imaging probe down.
