- Definition
	- every smooth vector field $V$ on an open subset $S$ of ${\mathbf {R} }^{n}$can be written as $$\sum_{i=1}^n V_i\left(x_1, \ldots, x_n\right) \frac{\partial}{\partial x_i}$$

- Gradient Fields
	- Conservative field
	- important in Physics
	- $$
	  \operatorname{grad} f=\nabla f=f_x(x, y, z) \mathbf{i}+f_y(x, y, z) \mathbf{j}+f_z(x, y, z) \mathbf{k}
	  $$
		- $f$ is called a potential function for F
	- The Cross-Partial Property of Conservative Vector Fields
		- if $$ \mathbf{F}(x, y, z)=\langle P(x, y, z), Q(x, y, z), R(x, y, z)\rangle $$ is a conservative field in R3, then
		- $$
		  \frac{\partial P}{\partial y}=\frac{\partial Q}{\partial x}, \frac{\partial Q}{\partial z}=\frac{\partial R}{\partial y}, \text { and } \frac{\partial R}{\partial x}=\frac{\partial P}{\partial z}
		  $$
