- To describe passive degrees-of-freedom, consider a link with two spherical joints at both ends. There exists a redundant degree-of-freedom about the axis defined by the two joints, by which the link can freely rotate.

- Most robot manipulators have the same number of actuators as the number of degrees-of-freedom required to perform their task. This type of manipulators is called fully parallel manipulators.
