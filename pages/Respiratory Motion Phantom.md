- [QUASAR™ Respiratory Motion Phantom (pRESP)](https://modusqa.com/products/quasar-respiratory-motion-phantom-presp/)
	- Radiation Therapy technologies, such as IGRT, SGRT and respiratory gating
	- QUASAR™ Respiratory Motion Phantom (pRESP) is a programmable breathing and tumour motion simulator for end-to-end quality assurance on motion-guided radiation therapy systems including CT, LINAC, and PET
	- features a vertical chest-wall platform that is compatible with a number of Surface Guided Radiation Therapy Systems (SGRT), such as: Vision RT, C-RAD, Brainlab, and Varian Identify.
	- Easily import patient-specific waveforms from various motion capture and waveform generating sources. Compatible with the following file formats: VXP, .CSV, .TXT, .DCM, .LOG, .DAF, .IMA
	- Simplicity
		- Modus QA has developed an easy to use phantom with comprehensive testing capabilities for demanding motion protocols in modern radiation therapy departments. From its manual operation mode to its magnetic insert connection, the pResp was designed with the end user in mind, providing an intuitive motion-management QA tool.
		- Quality Assurance Tool
	- Motion Control Options
		- Choose easy operation with local manual control at the motor or advanced programmable software driven control. The pRESP can produce **simple translational motion** or create **complex 3D patterns** with the QUASAR™ Respiratory Motion Rotation Stage (ITEM# 500-3330). With playback of motion waveforms, complexity is elevated to test the limits of your motion management systems.
	- Motion Precision
		- The QUASAR™ Respiratory Motion Phantom exhibits detailed sensitivity when replicating captured or created waveforms. A highly responsive motor repositions the translation stage every 10 mS (100x per second) providing real-life breathing replication. Waveforms from zero to 60BPM are replicated with ease, testing a large range of clinical protocols.
	- Versatility
		- Supporting a comprehensive library of interchangeable inserts, the pRESP is a flexible tool able to test techniques on CT, LINAC, and PET platforms. Perform end-to-end validation using a variety of imaging and dosimetry inserts including ion chamber holders, film cassettes and OSLD holders.
	- Software
		- Complex Motion Control Options
			- The QUASAR Respiratory Motion Phantom offers full control of your phantom’s motion profile. Our Respiratory Motion QA Software offers multiple operation modes to increase utility. From **adjustable sinusoidal waveforms** and simple test patterns to accurate playback of complex 3D waveforms, the pRESP offers the flexibility to choose your motion complexity for your required testing sequence.
		- Customizable Waveforms
			- In addition to an extensive library of pre-loaded waveforms, the Respiratory Motion QA Software enables the import of acquired waveforms from a number of respiratory gating and **motion tracking systems.** The waveforms are completely customizable, improving the user experience when modifying waveform patterns to achieve the desired testing protocol.
