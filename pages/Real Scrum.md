- What is Scrum
	- **The Team model: **The teamwork model Dr. Sutherland used while working at Mid-Continent Computer System
	- **High-performing team model knowledge:** Hirotaka Takeuchi and Ikujiro Nonaka
	- **Self-organization and self-management:** Robotic products of MIT (Massachusetts Institute of Technology) Artificial Intelligence Research Institute
	- **Daily stand-up:** Borland’s efficient team experience
	- **Product Demo:** AT&T Bell Labs Jim Coplien’s high-performing team experience
	- **Learning by the first Scrum team:** The Easel team read hundreds of management articles and books to accumulate knowledge. Ken Schwaber’s experience in Easel’s project too.
- 3 pillars of Scrum
	- Transparency
	- Inspect
	- Adapt
- OODA loop
	- **Observation:** The collection of data using the senses
	- **Orientation:** The analysis and synthesis of data to form one's current mental perspective
	- **Decision:** The determination of a course of action based on one's current mental perspective
	- **Action:** The physical playing-out of decisions
- **Scrum@Scale**
	- cross-team collaboration and general coordination problems and forms a super outcome-driven organization, whereas Scrum enables outcome-driven hyper-productive teams.

- 3 Roles
	- Product Owner
		- Responsible for maintaining the Product backlog
		- Represent the interests of stakeholders
		- Responsible for the team's ROI ratio.
		- Addition
			- A team works with a PO. A PO can work with multiple teams but most of the time a PO should only work with one team.
			- Is not a traditional command and control team leader, but a true leader who serves the team.
			- Can take the lead at work and will inspire others, instead of forcing work by pressuring others.
			- Is an effective communicator, so that he can connect, coordinate and synchronize others into the right movement and direction.
			- Have a strong level of understanding of the new way to work.
			- **Can lead the team to pursue excellence and to create business outcome** **(This is to be highlighted because this is the heart of this transformation)**
			- **A PO must always have a clear mind in the current market situation:**
				- How are we doing?
				- What additional features and values ​to be injected into the current product?
				- What could we do to make the product more successful?
			- **A PO is not a messenger of the stakeholders or the CPO. He is blessed with decision-making power.**
		- Criteria
			- **Must have**
				- Must be passionate about achieving business results
				- Must be willing and able to invest time in communicating with the team
				- Must have good communication skills and be able to maintain a good working relationship with stakeholders
				- Must have strong product acumen and can think independently
				- Must understand iterative product development
			- **Good to have**
				- Should have relevant domain knowledge and a good understanding of the market
				- Should have the right to make decisions, should be able to decide the vision and direction of the product
				- Should have a good understanding of the Scrum process
				- Should be proficient in **Lean Startup**
				- Should be sensitive to value delivery and ROI, and make appropriate judgments rapidly
			- **No need**
				- Technical knowledge (such as the ability to write code)
				- Ability to implement software features
				- Ability to test and find bugs
		- With Produce Backlog
			- Developing and explicitly communicating the Product Goal;
			- Creating and communicating Product Backlog items;
			- Ordering Product Backlog items; and,
			- Ensuring that the Product Backlog is transparent, visible, and understood.
			- Interaction steps
				- When a PO receives a goal from the person he works with, for example, a CPO or project stakeholder, he will digest the information, refine the goals, order them, and finally move it to the top of his Product Backlog so that they are ready to be accepted by the team. Each item written into the Product Backlog (PB) is called a Product Backlog Item (PBI). A PO is also the person in charge of this PB.
				- Then, he shows the PB and explains its PBI at the beginning of a work iteration. At the end of a work iteration, he must confirm what the team delivered is consistent with what he wanted as written in the PBI and as explained in the planning meeting at the beginning of a work iteration.
		- Produce Owner Level
			- CCCPO A. One person is responsible for the product line-level PB of the Office products.
			- CCPO B. For each product, Excel, Word, Powerpoint, etc., there will be a PO responsible for the PB of the products.
			- CPO Chief Product Owner C. Within each product, there are multiple feature sets. For each feature set, one PO is responsible for the PB. For example, there could be a team specializing in the Graphs & Charts feature sets, hence there is a match PO and PB for it.
			- PO D. In each feature set, multiple Scrum teams may be involved in implementation. Each team works with a PO and a PB as well.
		- In Scrum process
			- Phase 1
				- Before an iteration starts, sort out the product to-do list, refine each PBI, and rank it in its order of priority.
				- In the planning meeting, explain the iteration goals to the team. If the PBI in the product to-do list is vague or unclear, clarify and analyze it.
				- Observe various discussions of the team, answer questions, and discuss with the team to confirm the work commitment of this work iteration.
			- Phase 2
				- Communicate with all stakeholders and superior POs, sort out the product to-do list for the next iteration.
				- While the team is working, the developers will have questions. The PO answers them.
				- Participate in Daily Scrum meetings to understand work progress.
				- Some PBI development will encounter difficulties and involve spontaneous choices. A PO makes decisions and communicates with the team.
				- If the team cannot fulfill all the commitments in this work iteration, the PO needs to think about how to resolve the situation, perhaps replacing or abandoning some low-value PBI.
			- Phase 3
				- In the review meeting, observe the work results demonstration. Accept or reject the deliverable.
				- Participate in retrospectives to discuss about process optimization.
	- Scrum Master

- 5 Events
	- Sprint
		- Scrum is an iterative development model, in which time is divided into iterations of equal-length.
		- Each iteration is 1 Sprint, a sprint can be of a duration of 1-4 weeks depending on the preference of the Scrum team.
		- All other events must be completed within the time box (i.e., within 1 iteration)
	- Sprint Planning
		- It is the first event in the Sprint.
		- A good plan requires a good start to lead to success
	- Daily Scrum
		- The team synchronizes work progress every day so that everyone knows about the work progress and can visualize if the work commitment can be done.
		- The Scrum team can also make visible problems and impediments encountered since the last Daily Scrum.
		- This meeting should not exceed 15 minutes.
	- Sprint Review
		- A Scrum Team is required to demonstrate its deliverables before the end of each Sprint in the Sprint Review event.
		- It's a great way to receive product feedback.
		- Good feedback enables product improvements.
		- Product improvements usually lead to improved business results.
	- Sprint Retrospective
		- A retrospective is a time for a Scrum team to self-reflect and improve. Just as we need to improve our product continuously, we need to improve the way we work from time to time.
		- The team talks about what happened in the previous Sprint, the problems encountered and looks for a way to improve.
		- Retrospective makes good teams great.
		- Sprint Retrospective is a separate meeting that takes place after the Sprint Review and focuses on the team's performance and the process used during the sprint.
- 3 Artifacts
	- Product Backlog
		- capture the worklist of a Scrum team.
		- The Product Owner populates the Product Backlog with Product Backlog items.
		- It is a list of items, sorted by priority.
		- During the Sprint Planning, the Product Owner presents the highest priority items from the list, explains them, so that the team is clear.
		- The team can in turn makes relevant choices and commitments based on its estimated capacity and capabilities.
	- Sprint Backlog
		- The Sprint Backlog is composed of the Sprint Goal (why), the set of Product Backlog items selected for the Sprint (what), as well as an actionable plan for delivering the Increment (how).
		- The Sprint Backlog is a plan by and for the Developers.
	- Increment
		- At the end of each iteration, the team must deliver work results.
		- An increment must meet certain quality standards so that the Product Owner can choose to ship it immediately when he recognizes that the increment delivers business value.
- **How to build an excellent team**
	- **Lighten up**
	- First, understand how the team works in the current company landscape
	- Commit to making changes based on the Scrum model
	- Decide a general direction of work
	- Select suitable personnel to join the pilot team (form a team)
	- Transfer the work to the PO of the team
- **Creating desirable landscape**
