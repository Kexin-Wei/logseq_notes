	- Small pressure?
	  [Müller-Platte Needle Probe | Müller Instruments](https://mueller-instruments.de/en/pressure-measurement/mueller-platte-needle-probe)
	  For very **small pressures**, quite long signal duration and longer cables than 3 m we offer our special high bandwidth charge amplifier, MCPA 10, which runs cable lengths up to 150 m.
	- Medium Problem
	  Is deionized water same as degased water?

	  The transducers were placed inside a tank filled with **deionized (DI) water** and were driven by a function generator with a burst-mode sinusoidal waveform at pulse repetition interval of 1 ms.
