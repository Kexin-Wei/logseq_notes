	- A 2006 systematic review showed that 12 is the minimum number of cores for systematic biopsies, with > 12  cores not increasing cancer detection rate significantly
	- Additional cores should be obtained from suspect areas identified by DRE or on pre-biopsy MRI; multiple cores  (3–5) should be taken from each MRI-visible lesion

	- A systematic biopsy should include a minimum of 12 cores, distributed throughout the prostate, with thorough sampling of the peripheral zone. ((650d3be0-1f49-4cc9-9ab7-c02241460ec2))
	- In performing a biopsy, these goals appear to be best achieved through a 12-core systematic sampling methodology that incorporates apical and far-lateral cores in the template distribution. ((650d3bef-63ab-4b5d-9387-5298e5290279))
	- The NCCN panel suggests an “extended-pattern 12-core biopsy” that includes the standard sextant; peripheral base, mid-gland, and apex; and lesion-directed palpable nodules or suspicious images.
	- The other panels do not specify the regions of the prostate to sample, although the Italian panel recommends biopsy protocols directed to the peripheral-lateral zone.
	- Only the Italian guidelines address biopsy specimen labeling with a recommendation to package biopsy specimens from different sides and different areas (e.g., base, mid-gland, and apex) in separate containers; however, core specimens from the same area should be packaged in the same container.
	- This group also suggests that specimens from different sides and areas be labeled and that no more than two or three specimens be placed in the same container.
