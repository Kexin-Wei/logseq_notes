- Interpolation
	- **Bilinear** interpolation is a relatively simplistic method of calculating pixel brightness values from B-mode line samples. **Alternative interpolation** methods which more closely replicate the real profile of the ultrasound beam may be used but such methods require much more **complex** computations and hence increase the **system cost**.
