	    ```
	- fresh hand following the tutorial, get cricked out because of ssh update after the buildung the instance. find solution [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26193535/error-gcloud-compute-ssh-usr-bin-ssh-exited-with-return-code-255#:~:text=If%20you%20have%20installed%20gcloud%20without%20sudo%2C%20you%20can%20omit%20sudo%20.&text=255%20is%20the%20interactive%20ssh,executed%20in%20the%20ssh%20session.&text=Go%20to%20your%20google%20cloud,tab%20and%20click%20on%20edit.). MAKE SURE THE INSTANCE IS RUNNING!!!
