- [[@A blood–brain barrier overview on structure, function, impairment, and biomarkers of integrity]]
- controlling the influx and efflux of biological substances essential for the brain’s metabolic activity as well as neuronal function
- the functional and structural integrity of the BBB is pivotal to maintain the homeostasis of the brain microenvironment.
- Definition
	- a biological barrier at the blood to brain interface effectively separating the brain from the rest of the body
	- Biological barriers are protecting the brain. a Blood–brain barrier; b blood–CSF barrier; c the arachnoid barrier

	- The second barrier is the blood–cerebrospinal fluid barrier (BCSFB), which is formed by the epithelial cells of the choroid plexus.
- Physiological functions of the BBB at the blood–brain interface
	- Maintain ionic homeostasis and brain nutrition
	- Regulate levels of neurotransmitters
	- Limit plasma macromolecules leak into the brain
- Transport across the BBB
	- Passive diffusion: a wide range of lipid-soluble molecules
	- Active efflux: Several ATP-binding cassette (ABC) proteins are expressed on the luminal, blood-facing endothelial plasma membrane of the BBB.
	- Carrier-mediated transport (CMT):
		- The BBB isolates the brain and limits the diffusion of many essential polar nutrients, including glucose and amino acids, which are essential for metabolism.
		- CMTs are encoded genes within the Solute Carrier (SLC) Transporter Gene Family. This includes more than 300 transporter genes encoding membrane-bound proteins that facilitate the transport of a wide array of substrates across biological membranes
	- Receptor-mediated transport (RMT)
		- The presence of peptide bonds limits the larger peptides and proteins from using the amino acid CMT systems to cross the BBB
	- Major facilitator superfamily: Essential omega-3 fatty acids, such as docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)
	- Immune cell movement across the BBB
- BBB disruption in different pathological conditions
	- hypoxic and ischemic insult
	- Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s disease
	- epilepsy
	- brain tumors
	- glaucoma
	- lysosomal storage diseases
