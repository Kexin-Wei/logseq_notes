- What is Transducer?
  title:: Transducer Theory

	- A transducer is a device that converts energy from one form to another. Usually a transducer converts a signal in one form of energy to a signal in another.
	- mechanical transducers: convert physical quantities into mechanical quantities
	- electrical transducers: convert physical quantities into electrical quantities.

	- sensor: receives and responds to a signal or stimulus from a physical system. It produces a signal, which represents information about the system, which is used by some type of telemetry, information or control system.
	- actuator: responsible for moving or controlling a mechanism or system.
	- Bidirectional transducers: convert physical phenomena to electrical signals and also convert electrical signals into physical phenomena
	- Transceivers: integrate simultaneous bidirectional functionality. The most ubiquitous example are likely radio transceivers (in aircraft called transponders), used in virtually every form of wireless (tele-)communications and network device connections. Another example are ultrasound transceivers that are used for instance in medical ultrasound (echo) scans.
- Characteristics
	- Dynamic range
		- =Amplitude range ratio: This is the ratio between the largest amplitude signal and the smallest amplitude signal the transducer can effectively translate.
		- Transducers with larger dynamic range are more "sensitive" and precise.
	- Repeatability: This is the ability of the transducer to produce an identical output when stimulated by the same input.
	- Noise
		- All transducers add some random noise to their output.
		- In electrical transducers this may be electrical noise due to thermal motion of charges in circuits.
		- Noise corrupts small signals more than large ones.
	- Hysteresis: This is a property in which the output of the transducer depends not only on its current input but its past input.
- Type based on moving methods
	- Electronic
	- Mechanical
	- Electronic + mechanical: treatment volume is maximal
- Characteristics: With higher frequency, the focal zone of the HIFU will decrease
