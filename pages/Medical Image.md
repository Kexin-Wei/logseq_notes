		- World coordinate system:
			- Cartesian coordinate system
			- Every model (e.g. a MRI scanner or a patient) inside has its own coordinate system
		- Anatomical coordinate system

			- If the patient lies face up in the MRI or CT System as shown in the image above, the¬†*xyz¬†*world system and the¬†*lps¬†*patient system will coincide. This is the assumed standard system in DICOM.

			- The¬†ùëñ¬†axis increases to the right, the¬†ùëó¬†axis to the bottom and the¬†ùëò¬†axis backwards.

	- ## [Intro of DICOM](https://theaisummer.com/medical-image-coordinates/#introduction-to-dicom-for-machine-learning-engineers)
		- DICOM has naturally become the industry standard.
		- DICOM is both a file format and a networking protocol.
		- it contains a huge amount of meta-data with the image (and usually redundant).
			- The meta-data contains critical information that must be kept within the file to ensure they are never separated from each other.
			- ![1280X1280.PNG](../assets/1280X1280_1721710021377_0.PNG){:height 223, :width 691}
		- A DICOM *data set* is a ordered list of data elements.
			- The order of the list is the order of the tags of the data elements.
			- Ultrasound image structure can refer from [here](https://dicom.innolitics.com/ciods/us-image).
			- ![1280X1280.PNG](../assets/1280X1280_1721709935972_0.PNG){:height 448, :width 665}
	- ## DICOM Element
		- Every DICOM Element has a Tag, a Data Type called VR (acronym for Value Representation), Length and Value.
			- ![1280X1280 (1).PNG](../assets/1280X1280_(1)_1721710110910_0.PNG)
		- In the dump above the lines starts with the tag number (gggg,eeee), then the VR Code, then the value (strings are printed in square brackets) and then a hash sign ( # ) followed by the element value length, a comma, then Value multiplicity (which we'll talk about later) and the tag name.
			- ![1280X1280 (2).PNG](../assets/1280X1280_(2)_1721710124311_0.PNG)
		- The tag name and multiplicity are add by the dump method.
	- ## DICOM Module
		- Image related modules:
			- ![1280X1280 (3).PNG](../assets/1280X1280_(3)_1721710169439_0.PNG)
		- ### Image Pixel Module
			- [in DICOM Standard](https://dicom.nema.org/medical/Dicom/2017c/output/chtml/part03/sect_C.7.6.3.html)
			- All DICOM Objects must include the SOP (The classes of the DICOM static data model) Common Module and modules from the four main IE‚Äôs (Information Entities): Patient, Study, Series and Image
			- Rows (0028,0010) and Columns (0028,0011) define the size of the image as Height (Y) and Width (X).
			- Samples per pixel (0028,0002) define the number of color channels.  
			  In grayscale images like CT and MR it is set to 1 for the single grayscale channel and for color images like in our case it is set to 3 for the three color channels Red, Green and Blue.
			- Photometric interpretation (0028,0004)  is the color space used to encode the image.
				- "RGB" meaning the first channel ir Red, the second is Green and the third is Blue.
				- "MONOCHROME2" meaning its grayscale and 0 should be interpreted as Black.
			- Planar configuration (0028,0006) defines how the color channels are arranged in the pixel data buffer. More in [Chapter 12: Pixel Data - dicomiseasy.blogspot.com](http://dicomiseasy.blogspot.com/2012/08/chapter-12-pixel-data.html)
			- Bits Allocated, Bits Stored and High Bit: More in [Chapter 12: Pixel Data - dicomiseasy.blogspot.com](http://dicomiseasy.blogspot.com/2012/08/chapter-12-pixel-data.html)
			- Pixel Representation (0028,0103) is either unsigned (0) or signed (1)
			- Number of Frames (0028,0008) defines how many frames are in the image.
			- Pixel data element (7FE0, 0010)
		- ### The Image Plane module
			- [in DICOM Standard](https://dicom.nema.org/medical/Dicom/2016b/output/chtml/part03/sect_C.7.6.2.html)
			- The Image Plane module is part of the CT Image IOD (Information Object Definition) and the MR Image IOD and any other object that have a frame of reference, i.e. that has a spatial coordinates system related to the patient or in other words is a 3D scan of the body.

		- ### Voxel space to physical space
			- RCS(Reference Coordinates System) in DICOM is LPH / LPS
			- ![f313c65e-b001-410b-b78c-5a20cac4a4d5.png](../assets/f313c65e-b001-410b-b78c-5a20cac4a4d5_1721710292502_0.png){:height 416, :width 741}
				- Image Position (0020,0032) specifies the x, y, and z coordinates of the upper left hand corner of the image; it is the center of the first voxel transmitted.
				- Image Orientation (0020,0037) specifies the direction cosines of the first row and the first column with respect to the patient.
					- Image Orientation (Patient) (0020,0037) has 6 values (VM = 6).
					- It's two Normalized 3D vectors(i.e. directions) (Xx, Xy, Xz) (Yx, Yy, Yz)
					- These are direction cosines of the image plane relative to the RCS.
