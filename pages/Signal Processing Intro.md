- Characterise Signal
	- in time domain
	- in transform domain
		- Fourier transform
			- sinusoidal signal
			- continuous and discrete
		- Z-transform
			- discrete time only
		- Laplace transform
			- continuous time only
- Characterise System
	- Impulse response
		- output signal when the input is an impulse
		- unit impulse signal

	- Frequency response
	- Fourier transform: Impulse response -> frequency response
	- Z-transform / Laplace transform: impulse response -> transfer function
- Digital Filtering
  ![](/../assets/signal_processing.png)
	- $x(t)$: continuous signal
	- $x[n]$: discrete signal
	- Filtering
		- pointwise operator: $y[n]=(x[n])^2$
		- running average filter: $y[n]=\frac{1}{3}(x[n-1]+x[n]+x[n+1])$
- Linear Filter
	- attenuate certain frequency
	- pass certain frequency
	- affect both phase and magnitude
	- IIR Infinite Impulse Response
		- Mostly non-linear phase response
		- Could be linear over a range of frequencies
	- FIR Finite Impulse Response
		- Much easier to control the phase
		- Both non-linear and linear phase
