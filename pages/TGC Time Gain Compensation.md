- Reason: Attenuation
  ![](/../assets/attenuation.png)
	- When an ultrasound wave propagates through soft tissue, the **energy** associated with the wave is gradually **lost** so that its intensity reduces with distance travelled, an effect known as attenuation.
- Time-gain Control

  As echoes from deep targets take longer to arrive after pulse transmission than those from superficial ones, this effect can be achieved by increasing the amplification of echo signals with time. The technique is referred to as time-gain compensation (TGC).
