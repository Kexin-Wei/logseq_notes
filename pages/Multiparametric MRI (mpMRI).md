- Multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) is the most commonly used MRI technique for evaluating the prostate. MpMRI combines several different imaging sequences to provide a comprehensive assessment of the prostate gland. The primary sequences included in mpMRI are:
- T1-weighted imaging (T1WI): This sequence is used to assess the anatomy of the prostate and detect areas of hemorrhage, which can sometimes be seen in prostate cancer.
- T2-weighted imaging (T2WI): This sequence provides high-resolution anatomical details of the prostate, including the peripheral zone, central gland, and transition zone. T2WI is particularly useful for identifying the location and extent of prostate cancer, as well as benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH).
- Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI): This sequence measures the diffusion of water molecules in tissues and can help distinguish between cancerous and non-cancerous areas within the prostate. DWI is highly sensitive to detecting cancer, especially in the peripheral zone.
- Dynamic contrast-enhanced imaging (DCE): This sequence involves the injection of a contrast agent (gadolinium) to evaluate the blood flow and vascular permeability within the prostate. DCE can help identify areas of abnormal blood flow, which may be indicative of cancer.
- By combining these sequences, mpMRI can provide valuable information on the presence, location, and aggressiveness of prostate cancer, aiding in diagnosis, staging, and treatment planning. MpMRI is also useful in guiding prostate biopsies, as it can help identify suspicious areas that may be targeted for biopsy.
