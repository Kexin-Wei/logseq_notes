- Datasets:
	- Hyperfine Project Ideas
		- Retrain segmentation algorithm on generated lesion and submit to the challenge (this should improve ranking).
		- Downgrade the data by adding noise and reducing resolution as a simple transformation to low-field-like appearance.
		- Use LLM to train (or finetune opensource LLM model from Meta) on large scale radiology report dataset (e.g.: https://physionet.org/content/mimic-cxr/2.0.0/). I wish we had one for MRI.
			- take weeks to review application...
		- Develop system to retrieve reports with specific queries about the findings. This will be much more powerful than query search.
		- Use labeled dataset for lesion simulation and generation
			- **Multimodal MRI infarct segmentation in acute and sub-acute stroke.**: https://isles22.grand-challenge.org/dataset/
			- **Single channel T1-weighted lesion segmentation in acute, sub-acute and chronic stroke (ATLAS challenge)**: https://atlas.grand-challenge.org/
		- Insert the lesion into another dataset
			- Insert the lesion into another dataset: https://www.humanconnectome.org/study/hcp-young-adult/document/1200-subjects-data-release (200GB +)

	- Identifeye Project Ideas (open-ended)
		- We are currently focusing on fundus images - and our first application is Diabetic Retinopathy and in the pipeline we have a big focus on cardiovascular.
		- Some of the most straight forward from the public databases:
		- MESSIDOR/MESSIDOR-2/IDRiD and Kaggle DR set for DR
		- DRIVE and STARE for a variety but they're often used for vessel segmentation
		- AIROGS and REFUGE for glaucoma
		- AREDS for AMD
		- UKB is great but access is not trivial to get access to
		- If you want something easy and straightforward to obtain, start with the DR and maybe DRIVE and STARE
