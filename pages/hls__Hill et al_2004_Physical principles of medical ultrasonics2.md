- Consider now that the incident wave is a harmonic wave, with period T and frequency f0 . The reflected wave appears to exhibit a period that is related to T in the same way that TD is related to TW, and thus the observed frequency, f R, of the reflected wave is given by

- Figure 10.5. A single scatterer in a CW field will produce a single uniform Doppler shift in the reflected signal (top). Typical real systems involve non-uniform scatterer motion, multiple scatterers and pulsed wave signals, all of which contribute to the broad range of frequencies usually present in a typical Doppler signal
