	- T1-weighted and T2-weighted images, often referred to as T1 and T2 images.
	- T1 and T2 are fundamental properties of all tissues. They describe the two kinds of relaxation
	  which allow the protons to get back to their equilibrium condition.
	- T1 is known as spin–lattice or longitudinal relaxation time and is always longer than T2.
	- T2 is known as spin–spin or transverse relaxation time.
	- T1 : bright is fat
		- T1 images can be thought of as a map of proton energy within fatty tissues of the body
		- Fatty tissues include subcutaneous fat (**SC fat**) and bone marrow of the vertebral bodies
		- Cerebrospinal fluid (**CSF**) contains no fat – so it appears black on T1-weighted images
	- T2 :  bright is fat and water
		- T2 images are a map of proton energy within fatty **AND** water-based tissues of the body
		- Fatty tissue is distinguished from water-based tissue by comparing with the T1 images – anything that is bright on the T2 images but dark on the T1 images is fluid-based tissue
		- For example, the **CSF** is white on this T2 image and dark on the T1 image above because it is free fluid and contains no fat
		- Note that the bone cortex is black – it gives off no signal on either T1 or T2 images because it contains no free protons
