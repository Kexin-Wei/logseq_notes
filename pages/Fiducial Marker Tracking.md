- Steps:
	- Image segmentation: frame difference -> threshold -> boundary box
	- Marker Identification
		- feature detection using manual selected filter bank
		- "imfindcircles" Matlab to get center pot using  Hough Transformation
		- mean-shift algorithm to average different output of different filters
	- Unscented Kalman Filter Marker Tracking
