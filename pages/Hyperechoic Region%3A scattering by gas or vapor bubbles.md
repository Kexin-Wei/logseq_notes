title:: Hyperechoic Region: scattering by gas or vapor bubbles

- At first HIFU pulse, hyperechoic region appears at where inertial cavitation was detected
  ((633107ed-bd4e-4493-aed1-1c69926679fc))
- inertial cavitation was observed during or before the onset of the hyperechoic region
  ((a1ad4214-41f0-4667-b09d-b4d188e55ceb))
- Happens after cavitation (2.5s later in  5 of 22 HIFU exposures)
