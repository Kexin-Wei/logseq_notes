- a computerized x-ray imaging procedure in which a narrow beam of x-rays is aimed at a patient and quickly rotated around the body, producing signals that are processed by the machine’s computer to generate cross-sectional images, or “slices.”
- Once a number of successive slices are collected by the machine’s computer, they can be digitally “stacked” together to form a three-dimensional (3D) image of the patient that allows for easier identification of basic structures as well as possible tumors or abnormalities.
- PET/CT
	- PET
		- Positron emission tomography (PET) is a type of nuclear medicine procedure that measures metabolic activity of the cells of body tissues.  [source](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/treatment-tests-and-therapies/positron-emission-tomography-pet)
		- A small amount of radioactive glucose (a sugar) is injected into a vein. The PET scanner takes a picture of where glucose is being used in the brain.
