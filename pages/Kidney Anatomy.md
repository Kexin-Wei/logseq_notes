	  collapsed:: true
		- novel applications in renal US have been introduced with **contrast-enhanced ultrasound** (CEUS), **elastography** and **fusion imaging**.
		- CEUS [Cokkinos2013]
		  collapsed:: true
			- **(More for diagnosis, may not suitable for motion tracking)**
			- allows **real-time** evaluation of **microvasculature** which Colour Doppler ultrasound (US) cannot detect
			- of particular usefulness for answering many clinical questions in the kidneys, including detection and characterisation of **lesions**, based on differences between lesion and organ perfusion, differentiation between solid renal masses and pseudotumours, as well as between cystic and solid lesions.
			- can also be performed for characterising complex **cystic** renal masses and grading them with the Bosniak system, imaging renal ischaemia, infections, and trauma, as well as facilitating vascular imaging for renal artery stenosis.
			- can be performed for the assessment of percutaneous ablation therapy for kidney tumours.
			- In renal US examination, CEUS can be used to **differentiate tumor and pseudotumor**, such as prominent columns of Bertin. Pseudotumors enhance as adjacent renal tissue. The use of CEUS is recommended in special cases to distinguish between cystic and hypovascularized solid lesions, to characterize complex cysts, abscesses, traumatic lesions and ischemic lesions.

			- Right kidney scanning approach
				- anterior
				- lateral
				- posterior
				- Liver is the acoustic window
			- Left kidney
				- requires a posterior approach, through the spleen
				- Air-filled bowel impedes anterior scanning
