- The Doppler principle states that the frequency of transmitted sound is altered when the source is moving in relation to the observer.

- The relationship between blood flow V and the Doppler shift is expressed mathematically by the formula V = c2.F t Fr − F t cos θ , where the Doppler shift (Fr − F t ) is the difference between the frequency of the transmitted ultrasound wave (F t ) and the frequency of the ultrasound wave that returns to the transducer(F r ), c is the speed of sound in tissue, and θ is the angle between the direction of blood flow and the propagation direction of the ultrasound beam.
