		- ### Session 0 : Foundations of AI Agents
		- ### What is an AI Agent?
		  
		  Objective: Understand the basics of ai agents 
		  
		  *autonomous: designed to perform independently 
		  
		  An AI agent is an autonomous  system that interacts with its environment to achieve specific goals.

		- ### 1. Agent
		- The agent is
		  the entity that makes decisions and takes actions in an environment in 
		  order to achieve a specific goal. In reinforcement learning, the agent 
		  learns from its interactions with the environment to maximize some 
		  cumulative reward over time.
		- ### 2. Environment
		- The environment represents
		  everything the agent interacts with and learns from. It defines the 
		  setting in which the agent operates and provides the agent with feedback
		  based on the agent’s actions.
		- ### 3. State
		- The state is
		  a specific configuration or condition of the environment at any given 
		  time. It provides the agent with the necessary information to make 
		  decisions. The state can include both observed variables and hidden 
		  factors, depending on the problem.
		- ### 4. Action
		- An action is
		  any decision or move that the agent can take in response to the current
		  state. The set of all possible actions is called the action space. The agent selects actions based on its current state and its policy (a strategy for choosing actions).
		- ### 5. Reward
		- The reward is
		  a numerical value given to the agent after it performs an action in a 
		  given state. The reward indicates how good or bad the agent’s action was
		  in achieving its goal. The agent's objective is typically to maximize 
		  the cumulative reward over time (often referred to as the "return").
