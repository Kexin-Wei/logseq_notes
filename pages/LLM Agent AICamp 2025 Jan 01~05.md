		- ### Session 0 : Foundations of AI Agents
		- ### What is an AI Agent?
		  
		  Objective: Understand the basics of ai agents 
		  
		  *autonomous: designed to perform independently 
		  
		  An AI agent is an autonomous  system that interacts with its environment to achieve specific goals.

		- **Agentic AI** refers to advanced AI systems that demonstrate a higher degree of independence, initiative, and adaptability. While traditional AI agents operate within ==predefined frameworks==, agentic AI pushes the boundaries by showcasing characteristics that make them appear more "agent-like," often capable of pursuing open-ended goals.
