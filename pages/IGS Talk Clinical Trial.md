	- pre-clinical: safety indicates phase 1 subjects
	- phase 1: safety
	- phase 2: dose ranging right
		- Phase 2.a: different level of dose
		- Phase 2.b: control arm / placebo arm
	- phase 3: demo to doctors
	- phase 4: after sale

	  Diagnostic test should help decide the treatment
- # Randomized Controlled Clinical Trial
	- most convincing way
	- randomly select for treatment arm and the control arm
		- control
		- placebo
		- blinding
		- double-blind
	- other trials
		- observational
		- single arm ( invasive procedures )
		- synthetic arm ( rare diseases )
- # Clinical Protocol
	- patient selection
		- age, gender, severity, acute/chronic
	- procedure
		- dose
		- fit for current SoC?
		- training of clinicians
	- Endpoints
		- primary ( success or fail )
		- secondary ( fail will have hard time to pressure )
		- statistical significance and power - false negatives and false positives
- # Help
	- CRO ( small but local ), CRA
	- Quality, regulatory , manufacturing, notified bodies ( individual consultants )
