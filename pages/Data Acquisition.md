- What is DAQ?
  Data acquisition (DAQ) is the process of measuring an electrical or physical phenomenon, such as voltage, current, temperature, pressure, or sound. A DAQ system consists of sensors, DAQ measurement hardware, and a computer with programmable software.
- Measurement Types
	- Voltage
	- Current
	- Temperature
	- Sound and Vibration
	- Strain, Pressure, and Force
- Synchronization Timing Sources
	- IRIG Time Code
	- GPS PPS
	- NTP
	- EtherCAT
	- PTP V2
- Synchronization Types
  There are essentially three types of synchronization that Dewesoft DAQ systems support. In addition, single or multiple DAQ instruments can be referenced to an external absolute time reference.
	- Synchronizing channels on a single DAQ system: Internal Synchronization
	- Synchronizing channels between multiple DAQ systems:
		- Local Synchronization
		- Remote Synchronization
		- Absolute Time Reference
