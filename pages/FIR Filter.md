- FIR Filter
  $$y[n] = \sum^M_{k=0}b_kx[n-k]$$
	- Order: $M$
	- Length: $L=M+1$
	- FIR system
	  systems for which the impulse response has finite duration
	  impulse response= filter coefficients
	  $h[k]=b_k$
	  $\text{Output}=h[k]*\text{Input}$
	  ->convolution= filter definition

- FIR Properties
	- Pro
		- require no feedback of output, simple implementation
		- always stable, if $|x|\le B_x$ ->$|y|\le\sum^N_{k=0}|a_k|B_x$
		- can easily designed to be linear phase by making the coefficient sequence symmetric
	- Con
		- Requires more taps and computational power is required compared to an IIR filter with similar sharpness or selectivity, especially for low frequency cut-offs.

- Filter Specification

- Window Method
	- Ideal low-pass filters have inâ€€nite length of duration.
	- Windowing is truncating the ideal low pass impulse response.
	- Windowed impulse response is not ideal but an approximation
	- There are different types of windows.
