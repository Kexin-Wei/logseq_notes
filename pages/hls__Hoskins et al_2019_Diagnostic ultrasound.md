- Figure 7.13 PW Doppler is a ‘phase-domain process’. The received ultrasound signal is shown in comparison to the reference signal for five consecutive ultrasound pulses. Also shown are the signal after the reference and received signal have been multiplied, and the final detected Doppler signal after low-pass filtering. The first ultrasound signal is in phase with the reference signal and the detected Doppler amplitude achieves its peak positive value. For consecutive echoes the received and reference signals become misaligned until, in the fifth pulse of this example, they are ‘out of phase’ and the detected Doppler amplitude reaches its peak negative value.
