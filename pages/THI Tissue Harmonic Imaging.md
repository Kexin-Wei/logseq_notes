- Definition
	- second harmonics
	- generated by tissue as a result of distal propagation of fundamental (transmitted) band
	- filter out fundamental echo
- Method
	- Transducers transmit a **broad band of frequencies** pulse.
	- Receive the fundamental or transmitted band and multiple harmonic bands that are generated by tissue
	  > The fundamental and harmonic bands will usually **overlap**, resulting in the corruption of the harmonic band by the higher intensity fundamental.
	- filtering of the fundamental component
- Pulse inversion sequence
	- send out two simultaneous pulses with a 180° difference in phase
	  > in nonlinear media, the two received signals are not identical in amplitude and consequently will not cancel in the sum signal
	- Advantage: high level of signal intensity obtained after the sum of both received signals
	- Drawback: decrease of the temporal resolution related to the double pulse and longer signal processing.
- Pro
	- The introduction of harmonics allows **increased penetration without a loss of detail**, by obtaining a clearer image at depth with significantly less compromise to the image quality caused by the use of lower frequencies.
	- This imaging mode could be used in different organs with a heightening of low-contrast lesions through artefact reduction, as well as by the induced greater intrinsic contrast sensitivity of the harmonic imaging mode.
