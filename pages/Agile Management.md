- Values
	- Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
	- Working software over comprehensive documentation
		- Document is created only when it's necessary
		- In research, the final report is necessary
	- Customer cooperation over contract negotiation
		- The third value in the manifesto tells us that we need to collaborate with the customers, to create great products.
	- Responding to change over following a plan
