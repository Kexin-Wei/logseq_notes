- The first principal component (PC1) has the information that is common to all bands used. It contains high variance such that it gives more information about panchromatic image.

- It is advantageous over Fourier transform in that it provides desired resolution in time domain as well as in frequency domain whereas Fourier transform gives a good resolution in only frequency domain.
