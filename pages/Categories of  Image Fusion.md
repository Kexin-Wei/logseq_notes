- Multiview fusion
	- same modality, same time, different places or condition
	- supply complementary information from different views
- Multimodal fusion
	- [[US-CT Image Fusion]]
	- different modalities: PET, CT, MRI, visible, infrared, ultraviolet
	- decrease the amount of data, to emphasize band-specific information
	- Algorithm
		- Weighted averaging pixel-wise
		- Fusion in transform domains
		- Object-level fusion
		- rigid fusion: no compensation of patient motion and position
		- deformable fusion: structure or shape change
- Multimodal fusion with different resolution
	- One image with high spatial resolution, the other one with low spatial but higher spectral resolution
	- To get an image with high spatial and spectral resolution
	- Method: replacing bands in DWT (discrete wavelet transform)
- Multitemporal fusion
	- same scene, different time, (same modality)
	- detect the changes
	- Method: subtraction
- Multifocus fusion
	- The original image can be divided into regions such that every region is in focus in at least one channel
	- Method: identify the regions in focus and combine them together
- Fusion for image restoration
	- Each image consists of “true” part and “degradation”, which can be removed by fusion
	- Types of degradation
		- additive noise: image denoising, averaging over multiple
		- convolution: blind deconvolution
		- resolution decimation: superresolution
