- The success of the new algorithm is due to a technique that is suggested by the symmetric Broyden method for updating V 2 Q when first derivatives of F are available (see pages 195-198 of Dennis and Schnabel, 1983, for instance). Let an old model Qold be present, and let the new model Q,,, be required to satisfy some conditions that are compatible and that leave some freedom in the parameters of Q,,,. The technique takes up this freedom by minimizing IIV2Qne,-V2QoldllF, where the subscript "F" denotes the Frobenius norm

- . The choice of pbeg should be such that the computed values of F a t these points provide useful information about the behaviour of the true objective function near zo, especially when the computations may include some spurious contributions that are larger than rounding errors.

- Each change to p is a decrease by about a factor of ten, except that the iterations are terminated in the case p=pend
