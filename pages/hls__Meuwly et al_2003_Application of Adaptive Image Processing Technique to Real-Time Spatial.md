- smoothing is applied along an interface to improve continuity, whereas edge enhancement is applied in the perpendicular direction to improve spatial resolution

- In the current 2-dimensional(2D) case, there were 2 orthogonal eigenvectors, each associated with an eigenvalue describing the signal energy in its direction. A feature was classified as anisotropic if the ratio of large to small eigenvalue was above 2; otherwise, the feature was classified as isotropic.
