- A smarter approach for reducing the amount of data without loosing essential information is to apply a complex base-band modulation technique with bandwidth reduction known as IQdemodulation.

- The low-pass filter on the complex signal can be thought of as a filter applied to the real and imaginary part separately.

- Because we have a complex signal, the bandwidth of the signal equals the complex sampling rate (the complex signal doesn’t have an ambiguity between positive and negative frequencies).
