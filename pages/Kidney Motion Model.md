			- **Normal Respiration Condition**
				- Left kidney: 2-24mm
				- Right kidney: 4-35mm
			- Forced Respiration Condition
				- Left: 10-66mm
				- Right: 10-86mm
		- Patient variation big
			- some move greatly, some not
		- Left and right different
			- most of cases right > left
		- Cycle of kidney motion
			- motion during inspiration
			- rest at end of inspiration
			- motion during expiration
