	- Studies include T2-weighted (T2W), proton density-weighted (PD-W), dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE), and diffusion-weighted (DW) imaging.
	- The images were acquired on two different types of Siemens 3T MR scanners, the MAGNETOM Trio and Skyra.
	- T2-weighted images were acquired using a turbo spin echo sequence and had a resolution of around 0.5 mm in-plane and a slice thickness of 3.6 mm.
	- The DCE time series were acquired using a 3-D turbo flash gradient echo sequence with a resolution of around 1.5 mm in-plane, a slice thickness of 4 mm and a temporal resolution of 3.5 s.
	- The proton density weighted image was acquired prior to the DCE time series using the same sequence with different echo and repetition times and a different flip angle.
	- The DWI series were acquired with a single-shot echo planar imaging sequence with a resolution of 2 mm in-plane and 3.6 mm slice thickness and with diffusion-encoding gradients in three directions. Three b-values were acquired (50, 400, and 800), and subsequently, the ADC map was calculated by the scanner software. All images were acquired without an endorectal coil.
