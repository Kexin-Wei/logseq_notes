- [[@Ultrasound Elastography: Review of Techniques and Clinical Applications]]
	- Measurements are acquired in specialized imaging modes that can detect tissue stiffness in response to an applied mechanical force (compression or shear wave)
	- In general, these can be classified into strain imaging methods that use internal or external compression stimuli, and shear wave imaging that use ultrasound-generated traveling shear wave stimuli.

	- Strain Imaging
	  In this technique, a normal stress $\sigma_n$¬†is applied to tissue and the normal strain Œµn¬†is measured (Figure¬†[‚Äã(Figure1,1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5399595/figure/F1/), first column); Equation $\sigma= E\epsilon$is used to provide a qualitative evaluation of Young's modulus¬†E.

				- manual compression on the tissue with the ultrasound transducer
				  collapsed:: true
					- The manually or physiologically applied stress is not **quantifiable**
					- A pseudo-quantitative measurement called the strain ratio can be used, which is the ratio of strain measured in adjacent (usually normal) reference tissue region of interest (ROI) to strain measured in a target lesion ROI. A strain ratio >1 indicates that the target lesion compresses less than the normal reference tissue, indicating lower strain and greater stiffness
				- works fairly well for superficial organs such as the breast and thyroid
				- challenging for assessing elasticity in deeper located organs such as the liver

		- Acoustic Radiation Force Impulse ARFI
		  collapsed:: true
			- tissue displacement is generated by internal physiologic motion (e.g. cardiovascular, respiratory)
			- This is an alternative approach for measuring strain. In this technique a short-duration (0.1-0.5 ms) high-intensity (spatial peak pulse average = 1400 W/cm2, spatial peak temporal average = 0.7 W/cm2) acoustic ‚Äú**pushing pulse**‚Äù (acoustic radiation force) is used to **displace tissue** (displacement of ~ 10-20 Œºm) in the **normal direction**
			- Depth: ~6cm, deeper is impossible

			- In this technique, a dynamic stress is applied to tissue by using a mechanical vibrating device in 1D transient elastography (1D-TE) or acoustic radiation force in **point shear wave elastography (pSWE)** and 2D shear wave elastography (2D-SWE). Shear waves created by the excitation are measured perpendicular to the acoustic radiation force application or parallel to the 1D transient elastography excitation; the shear wave speed¬†$c_s$¬†is reported, or Young's modulus¬†_E_¬†is computed and reported using Equation $E=3G=3\rho c_s^2$.
			- SWI employs a dynamic stress to generate shear waves in the parallel or perpendicular dimensions.

				- based on multiple **A-mode lines** in time at different proximal locations assembled to form a low quality image
			- point shear wave elastography (pSWE)
			  collapsed:: true
				- ARFI is used to induce tissue displacement in the normal direction in a single focal location
				- portion of the longitudinal waves generated by ARFI is intra-converted to shear waves through the absorption of acoustic energy
				- The speed of the shear waves perpendicular to the plane of excitation¬†_cs_¬†are measured, which are either directly reported or converted Young's modulus¬†_E_¬†and reported to provide a quantitative estimate of tissue elasticity
				- pSWE can be performed on a conventional ultrasound machine using a standard ultrasound probe
				- unlike 1D-TE where the shear waves are produced by excitation at the body surface, pSWE produces shear waves which originate locally inside the liver, making pSWE less affected by ascites and obesity

	- Limitations
		- commercially available USE modes rely on a set of assumptions about the tissue material being examined to simplify analysis and interpretation of measurements/imaging. Core assumptions are that the tissue is:
			- linear; resulting strain linearly increases as a function of incremental stress (Equation 1)
			- elastic; tissue deformation is not dependent on stress rate, and tissue returns to original non-deformed equilibrium state
			- isotropic; the tissue is symmetrical/homogeneous and responds to stress the same from all directions
			- incompressible; the overall volume of tissue remains the same under stress applied.
