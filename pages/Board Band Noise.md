- broadband noise is produced by collapsing bubbles during inertial cavitation, and is by far the most widely used technique
- Detection Methods
	- Root-mean-square (RMS) amplitude in the frequency domain within a frequency window located between the harmonic peaks
		- was introduced and correlated to endothelial cell damage and hemolysis in vivo in several studies
	- Probability of cavitation occurrence
	- Cavitation persistence
